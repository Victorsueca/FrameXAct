As everyone who has ever searched for optimization mods knows,
Minecraft is one of the most optimized and efficient games made in the entire history of videogames.
So much so that your computer can turn all the fans at max power and
take off like an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter while you play at a whopping
2.3 frames per every time we find a proper job in today's economy.

 

## To fix this, this modpack does TWO and ONLY TWO things:


<ol start="1">
<li>Makes use of well-known publicly available mods made by people who definitely should be hired by Mojang
to bring Minecraft's performance to something more in line with recent standards rather than the ones
of an IBM PowerPC running DOS.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>Improves the reliability of the 6th point on this list.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>Teaches me how to count.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
<li>Provides plenty of options that allow you to either tweak and squeeze your performance to the maximum for your PC,
or use the extra performance to enable some cool visual features.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li>Improves the performance of the 2nd point on this list.</li>
</ol>
 

## TODO Before releasing:


Credit all mod authors in this README file.

Test exactly how many computers per square washing machine are we saving with this.

Prepare a version of the modpack in a format that Curseforge likes (at the moment it's just all the mods thrown into a zip file that I use to share around).

While preparing the modpack, avoid destroying the toilet. Yes, that's something that could happen. Don't worry, the chances of that happening are really low as there are no Taco Bell near my area.

Remove this unsurmountable amount of TODO garbage that I templated from my other WIP modpack and replace them by an actual, fancy formatted description.
